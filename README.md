<h1>Snake Game</h1>
Remember the iconic Snake game from the late '70s? Well, I’ve just recreated it using JavaScript and HTML! 🕹️

🍎 Objective: Navigate the snake to eat as many apples as possible without hitting the walls or its own body.

🔥 Features:

Canvas Magic: I used the HTML <canvas> element to draw the game board. The snake moves within this canvas.
Snake Movement: The snake automatically glides across the screen, and players can change its direction using arrow keys.
Growing Snake: Every time the snake devours an apple, it grows longer.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
🚀 Tech Stack: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Feel free to play it here and let me know what you think! 🎉
